# UTU Chess Elo System

This is a system that handles and keeps track of our chess club's (Yliopistonm√§en Shakkikerho at the University of Turku) games and player profiles. The chess club organizes tournaments once in two weeks which updates our system. We keep track of all games and player profiles in JSON files: games_database.json and players_database.json.

We implemented our own Elo rating system to the player profiles. Players get their updated Elo (that we named TYLO  = Turun yliopiston Elo) rating after every tournament.
